I designed `weblib` to be a simple and easy to use Rust HTTP library. Therefore, development on `weblib` should maintain its simplicity and ease of use.

If you would like to help out, your contributions in the following areas would be greatly appreciated:
- Reviewing PRs (if any)
- Reviewing issues
- Discovering issues and opening issues/PRs
- Writing documentation and modifying the project to work on Read the Docs or some other platform

Thanks - Mac
